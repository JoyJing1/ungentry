*Code for Boston cares about innovation and technology.  It also cares about the ways it affects its surroundings.*


Why are we doing this?
----------------------

  1. We want to contribute to the policy discussion about gentrification and possible displacement.
  2. We'd like to know more about how the influx of tech is related
  3. We like playing with data and maps

How can I help?
----------------------

Check out our brain storm on our [hackpad](https://codeforboston.hackpad.com/How-can-Code-for-Boston-contribute-to-the-policy-discussion-on-gentrification-in-Boston-fD9RvXalX84#:h=Variable-Wish-List).  

If you have information or ideas that you think would be helpful, add it there.

As we get further in the design process, we will update there and here in the readme.
